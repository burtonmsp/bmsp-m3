BurtonMSP M3 Colors for WP

We wanted a simple way to generate Material You colours for websites, but found that the official plugin didn't always play nicely with non-Gutenberg themes/builders.

This is a simple plugin that uses material components to generate a colour scheme from a primary colour and shows the palette in the plugin settings page.

In addition, for ease of coding, we implemented a click-to-copy of the color swatch in rgb format, and of the variable name so they can be quickly copied and pasted. On top of that, we've added a checkbox to wrap the variable name with var().

In M3 design the button corners are rounded, but we've added a button radius also.

This is a very basic plugin and was created for a very specific purpose, but if anyone else finds it useful or wishes to build on it, this is fine.
